# adventofcode

## Purpose

This repository will hold code written for various Advent of Code challenges. I intend to use this as a way of learning new languages as well as developing skills in ones I already know.

## Folder Structure

There will be a folder for each year, a subfolder for the day and part being answered. For example, code could be found at `2021/1-1` and `2021/1-2`.
